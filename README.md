# Uncommon HTML Bug: Accessing innerHTML of a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet common error in HTML and JavaScript interactions: attempting to modify the `innerHTML` property of a DOM element that does not exist. 

The `bug.html` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.html` file presents a corrected version.

## Description

The bug arises from the script trying to access and modify the `innerHTML` of an element with the ID "nonExistentElement". Since this element is not defined within the HTML structure, JavaScript throws an error.

This is a common mistake, especially when dynamically generating elements or dealing with asynchronous operations where element creation and manipulation might not be synchronized properly.   Robust error handling is important to prevent application crashes due to these types of issues.

## Solution

The solution involves checking for the existence of the element before attempting to modify its `innerHTML`.  This can be done using a simple conditional statement.
